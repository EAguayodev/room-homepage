## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process
- Take a look at the figma designs downloaded to create css class names and plan for the JavaScript code ahead of time to tackle the requirements of what the challenge was about.
- Structure the html content with written out class names for a fluid flow of making the challenge responsive.
- Write out JavaScript for toggling the menu, grabbing images, heading, and descriptions inside an array for displaying when user clicked arrow buttons.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript 
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
I Learned to use the setTimeout() to have text animations with transitions occur when clicking the arrow buttons for different texts and background images displaying.


### Continued development
When it comes to continued development, I'll be continuing to sharpen my skills with JavaScript and as I've mentioned in the past, I'll be picking fraemworks based on task complexity and requirements for project efficiency.



### Useful resources

- [Mikes magical mobile menu](https://codepen.io/tiffachoo/pen/yzZRXK) - Mikes mobile menu animation codepen helped me with creating the animation transitions to take effect for the mobile menu displays and transitions for displaying the different hero images and texts for the user after clicking the arrow buttons on the challenge.
